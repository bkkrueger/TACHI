Tools and Algorithms for Computational Hydrodynamic Investigations

The goal of this project is to develop a basic computational fluid dynamics
program in order to learn more about the algorithms and to have a testbed to
try new ideas.  A side goal is to compare programming languages.  Fortran is
often considered the gold standard of scientific computing, with C/C++ (nearly)
as good.  Python is rapidly growing in popularity, and has released many
mechanisms for speeding up numerics, including NumPy, Numba, NumExpr, Hope, and
PyPy.  Julia is a newer high-level language, comparable to Python, but designed
with scientific computing in mind, and is thus expected to be a strong
competitor in terms of both ease of development and execution speed, but its
newness means it lacks the extensive libraries available for other languages.
